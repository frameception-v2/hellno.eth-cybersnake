Here's the organized todo list following the requirements:

### Frame Structure
- [ ] Create Canvas component with 2D context and dynamic viewport sizing (GameCanvas.tsx)
- [ ] Set up base Frame metadata tags with dynamic path generation (layout.tsx)
- [ ] Implement frame post endpoint handler for game state updates (app/api/frame/route.ts)
- [ ] Create SVG-based fallback component for frame preview images (FrameFallback.tsx)
- [ ] Configure frame message validation with hub compatibility checks (FrameValidator.ts)

### UI Components & Interactions
- [ ] Build touch control overlay with 5px deadzone threshold (TouchController.tsx)
- [ ] Implement retro score display using CSS text-shadow effects (ScoreDisplay.tsx)
- [ ] Create game state modals (win/lose/pause) using shadcn/dialog (GameModals.tsx)
- [ ] Add wallet connection button with shadcn components (WalletConnectionModal.tsx)
- [ ] Build settings panel with localStorage toggle switches (SettingsPanel.tsx)

### API Integration
- [ ] Set up Wagmi provider with injected wallet detection (RootProvider.tsx)
- [ ] Implement message signing interface with SIWE (SignatureManager.ts)
- [ ] Create frame image generation endpoint with dynamic game state (app/api/image/route.ts)
- [ ] Configure deep linking handlers for mobile wallet apps (DeepLinkHandler.tsx)
- [ ] Add error boundaries for failed wallet interactions (WalletErrorBoundary.tsx)

### Client-Side State Management
- [ ] Implement useReducer state machine for game logic (GameStateMachine.tsx)
- [ ] Create localStorage interface with version migration (LocalStorageManager.ts)
- [ ] Set up session persistence system with serialization (SessionManager.tsx)
- [ ] Add private browsing mode detection for storage fallback (StorageGuard.tsx)
- [ ] Implement game state synchronization across components (StateSync.ts)

### User Experience & Animations
- [ ] Create CSS scanline animation with gradient overlays (CRTEffect.css)
- [ ] Implement touch ripple feedback with radial gradients (TouchFeedback.tsx)
- [ ] Add smooth snake movement transitions using requestAnimationFrame (GameLoop.ts)
- [ ] Build orientation change handlers with debounced resize (OrientationManager.tsx)
- [ ] Create food spawn animation with particle effects (FoodSpawner.tsx)

### Mobile Optimization
- [ ] Configure viewport meta tags with mobile-scale constraints (meta.ts)
- [ ] Implement adaptive canvas scaling for landscape/portrait (CanvasScaler.tsx)
- [ ] Add 48px+ touch targets for control buttons (MobileControls.css)
- [ ] Create thermal throttling detector with quality adjustment (PerformanceMonitor.tsx)
- [ ] Set up memory pressure event handlers for mobile browsers (MemoryManager.tsx)
- [ ] Implement battery saver mode with reduced effects (PowerSaver.tsx)

Dependency Order:
1. Frame Structure → UI Components → Client State → UX Animations
2. API Integration depends on Client State
3. Mobile Optimization applies across all components
4. Performance tasks come after core functionality

This structure leverages:
- Next.js dynamic routes for frame endpoints
- shadcn UI components for consistent styling
- Canvas API for game rendering
- Web Animations API for smooth effects
- Farcaster Frame v2's enhanced capabilities:
  - Complex stateful interactions
  - Dynamic image generation
  - Extended button actions
  - Client-side state persistence
  - Direct wallet integration
